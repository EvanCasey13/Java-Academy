  Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.. The team began this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top boxes, television and a variety of other tech but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected for several reasons (For example: C++ required more memory). Gosling strived to alter and expand C++ however before long he surrendered that idea for making another stage called Green. James Gosling and his team called their project “Greentalk” and its file extension was .gt and later became to be known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oak_(programming_language)" target = "_blank">"OAK"</a>

  <p> 
<p>
    Gosling and his team had a brainstorm session and afterwards several names were thought of such as: JAVA, DNA, SILK and RUBY.

The name “Java” was selected after many long discussions due to the name being so unique, the name had originated from a type of espresso bean. Ironically, Gosling had thought of this name while having a cup of coffee in his office.
Java was created on the principles like Robust, Portable, Platform Independent, High Performance, Multithread, etc. and was called one of the Ten Best Products of 1995 by the TIME MAGAZINE.

Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business solutions and a wide range of other situations.

</p>

<p>
    Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1996. It promised Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) functionality, providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular.
</p>

<p>
    The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. “Java” has experienced a few changes since JDK 1.0 such as various augmentations of the classes and packages in the standard library. In Addition to the language changes, further changes have been made to the Java Class Library throughout the years, which has developed from a couple of hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to more than four thousand in Java SE 15.

  <p>
    In 1997, Sun Microsystems approached the ISO/IEC JTC 1 standards body and later the Ecma International to formalize Java, but it soon withdrew from the process. Java remains a de facto standard, controlled through the Java Community Process. At one time, Sun made most of its Java implementations available without charge, despite their proprietary software status. Sun generated revenue from Java through the selling of licenses for specialized products such as the Java Enterprise System.
  </p>

  <p>
    On November 13, 2006, Sun released much of its Java virtual machine (JVM) as free and open-source software (FOSS), under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). On May 8, 2007, Sun finished the process, making all of its JVM's core code available under free software/open-source distribution terms, aside from a small portion of code to which Sun did not hold the copyright.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sun's vice-president Rich Green said that Sun's ideal role with regard to Java was as an evangelist. Following Oracle Corporation's acquisition of Sun Microsystems in 2009–10, Oracle has described itself as the steward of Java technology with a relentless commitment to fostering a community of participation and transparency. This did not prevent Oracle from filing a lawsuit against Google shortly after that for using Java inside the Android SDK. The following year, On April 2, 2010, James Gosling resigned from Oracle.

  <p>
    Initial Release (versions 1.0 and 1.1):
    Introduced in 1996 for the Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic and Linux, Java was initially released as the Java Development Kit 1.0 (JDK 1.0). This included the Java runtime (the virtual machine and the class libraries), and the development tools (e.g., the Java compiler). Later, Sun also provided a runtime-only package, called the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The first name stuck, however, so usually people refer to a particular version of Java by its JDK version (e.g., JDK 1.0).
  </p>

  <p>
    Java 2 (version 1.2):
    Introduced in 1998 as a quick fix to the former versions, version 1.2 was the start of a new beginning for Java. The JDKs of version 1.2 and later versions are often called Java 2 as well. For example, the official name of JDK 1.4 is The Java(TM) 2 Platform, Standard Edition version 1.4.

    Kestrel (Java 1.3)
    Released on 8 May 2000. The most notable changes were:
    
    HotSpot JVM included (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April, 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM),
    RMI was modified to support optional compatibility with CORBA,
    JavaSound,
    Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) included in core libraries (previously available as an extension),
    Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) and
    Synthetic proxy classes.
  </p>


   <p>
    Merlin (Java 1.4)
    Released on 6 February 2002, Java 1.4 has improved programmer productivity by expanding language features and available APIs:
    
    Assertion,
    Regular Expression,
    XML processing,
    Cryptography and Secure Socket Layer (SSL),
    Non-blocking I/O (NIO) and
    Logging.
   </p>

   <p>
    Tiger (version 1.5.0; Java SE 5)
    Released in September 2004
    
    Major changes include:
    Generics - Provides compile-time type safety for collections :and eliminates the drudgery of casting.
    Autoboxing/unboxing - Eliminates the drudgery of manual conversion between primitive types (such as int) and wrapper types (such as Integer).
    Enhanced for - Shorten the for loop with Collections use.
    Static imports - Lets you import all the static part of a class.
    Annotation/Metadata - Enabling tools to generate code and deployment descriptors from annotations in the source code. This leads to a "declarative" programming style where the programmer says what should be done and tools emit the code to do it. Annotations can be inspected through source parsing or by using the additional reflection APIs added in Java 5 and
    JVM Improvements - Most of the run time library is now mapped into memory as a memory image, as opposed to being loaded from a series of class files. Large portion of the runtime libraries will now be shared among multiple JVM instances.
   </p>

   <p>
    Mustang (version 1.6.0; Java SE 6)
    Released on 11 December 2006.
    
    What's New in Java SE 6:
    
    Web Services - First-class support for writing XML web service client applications.
    Scripting - You can now mix in JavaScript technology source code, useful for prototyping. Also useful when you have teams with a variety of skill sets. More advanced developers can plug in their own scripting engines and mix their favorite scripting language in with Java code as they see fit.
    Database - No more need to find and configure your own JDBC database when developing a database application. Developers will also get the updated JDBC 4.0, a well-used API with many important improvements, such as special support for XML as an SQL datatype and better integration of Binary Large OBjects (BLOBs) and Character Large OBjects (CLOBs) into the APIs.
    More Desktop APIs - GUI developers get a large number of new tricks to play like the ever popular yet newly incorporated SwingWorker utility to help you with threading in GUI apps, JTable sorting and filtering, and a new facility for quick splash screens to quiet impatient users.
    Monitoring and Management - The really big deal here is that you don't need to do anything special to the startup to be able to attach on demand with any of the monitoring and management tools in the Java SE platform.
    Compiler Access - Really aimed at people who create tools for Java development and for frameworks like JavaServer Pages (JSP) or Personal Home Page construction kit (PHP) engines that need to generate a bunch of classes on demand, the compiler API opens up programmatic access to javac for in-process compilation of dynamically generated Java code. The compiler API is not directly intended for the everyday developer, but for those of you deafened by your screaming inner geek, roll up your sleeves and give it a try. And the rest of us will happily benefit from the tools and the improved Java frameworks that use this.
    Pluggable Annotations allows programmer to write annotation processor so that it can analyse your code semantically before javac compiles. For example, you could write an annotation processor that verifies whether your program obeys naming conventions.
    Desktop Deployment - At long last, Java SE 6 unifies the Java Plug-in technology and Java WebStart engines, which just makes sense. Installation of the Java WebStart application got a much needed makeover.
    Security - Java SE 6 has simplified the job of its security administrators by providing various new ways to access platform-native security services, such as native Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and cryptographic services on Microsoft Windows for secure authentication and communication, Java Generic Security Services (Java GSS) and Kerberos services for authentication, and access to LDAP servers for authenticating users.

   </p>

   <p>
    Spider (version 1.8.0; Java SE 8):

    Java 8 was released on 18 March 2014, and included some features that were planned for Java 7 but later deferred.
    
    Work on features was organized in terms of JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs).
    
    JSR 335, JEP 126: Language-level support for lambda expressions (officially, lambda expressions; unofficially, closures) under Project Lambda which allow the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. There was an ongoing debate in the Java community on whether to add support for lambda expressions. Supporting lambda expressions also allows the performance of functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as MapReduce-inspired transformations on collections. Default methods allow an author of an API to add new methods to an interface without breaking the old code using it. Although it was not their primary intent, default methods also allow multiple inheritance of behavior (but not state).
    JSR 223, JEP 174: Project Nashorn, a JavaScript runtime which allows developers to embed JavaScript code within applications,
    JSR 308, JEP 104: Annotation on Java Types,
    Unsigned Integer Arithmetic,
    JSR 337, JEP 120: Repeating annotations,
    JSR 310, JEP 150: Date and Time API,
    JEP 178: Statically-linked JNI libraries,
    JEP 153: Launch JavaFX applications (direct launching of JavaFX application JARs) and
    JEP 122: Remove the permanent generation
